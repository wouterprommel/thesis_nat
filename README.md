# Thesis Physics

This code is part of my bachelor thesis.
It calculates the cross-section of neutrino-nucleon scattering.

All results (incorrect and correct) can be found in the file cs_3.csv
The calculation can be done by running int_log.py (integration-log), for this the file NLO_functions2.py needs to be in the same directory.
